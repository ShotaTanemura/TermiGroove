Project emphasizes strict TDD with supporting spec workflows. Code follows Rust idioms, modular separation (state, input, UI, audio), and keeps popups/input logic encapsulated. Use descriptive enums for modes/focus, clamp numeric ranges, and maintain clean separation between state management and rendering. Documentation stored in Notion/spec-workflow; decision logs required for major changes.
