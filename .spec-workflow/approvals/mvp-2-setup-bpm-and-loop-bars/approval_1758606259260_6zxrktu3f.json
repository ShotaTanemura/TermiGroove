  "response": "Feedback Summary (1 comments):\n\nGeneral Comments:\n1. There is no description of the summary box’s design. The summary box is placed at the top-left of the pads screen, and its height is roughly two-fifths of the screen. It has a green border similar to the pads and, as of the current implementation, it contains the bpm and bars elements, aligned to the top. The items are shown as bpm: <number> and bars: <number>, arranged vertically. The labels “bpm:” and “bars:” are left-aligned, the numbers are right-aligned, and the gap between each label and its number is made as wide as possible. When it is focused with the arrow keys, a white rectangular outline appears that encloses the two elements (bpm and bars). When selected with the Enter key, the inside of the white outline is highlighted.\n\n",
