# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TermiGroove needs an immediate pause/resume control so live performers can momentarily stop layered loops without losing timing. The feature synchronizes playback and recording state across the audio engine and UI, ensuring precise stop/start behavior when the performer presses the spacebar.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This capability reinforces the product pillars of keyboard mastery and reliability. Instant pausing keeps command-line performers in flow, while deterministic resume protects live sets from timing drift, directly supporting the retro-futuristic, performance-ready identity outlined in `product.md`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a live performer managing layered loops, I want the spacebar to pause playback and recording instantly so that I can stop the performance without losing timing alignment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the loop is in `LoopState::Playing` AND the performer presses space once THEN the system SHALL transition the loop into `LoopState::Paused`, capturing the current playback position and broadcasting a `PauseAll` audio command within 1 ms.
2. WHEN the loop is in `LoopState::Recording` AND the performer presses space THEN the system SHALL persist both playback offset and active overdub offset prior to pausing.
3. WHEN the spacebar pause is triggered THEN the audio engine SHALL halt all active sinks without audible artifacts and SHALL retain handles needed for an eventual resume.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As the same performer, I want the spacebar to resume precisely from where I paused so that loop timing stays locked when I restart playback or recording.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the loop is in `LoopState::Paused` AND the performer presses space THEN the system SHALL compute a new `cycle_start` using the stored offset and SHALL resume playback commands aligned to the prior position with ≤1 ms drift.
2. IF recording was active when the pause occurred THEN the system SHALL restore overdub timers and resume recording without shifting existing layers.
3. WHEN resuming from pause THEN monitoring SHALL restart immediately and the UI SHALL reflect the state transition back to `LoopState::Playing` or `LoopState::Recording`.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performer relying on other keyboard controls, I want the pause behavior isolated so that unrelated flows continue working without regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the performer invokes other control sequences (e.g., cancel, navigation) THEN the system SHALL not emit `PauseAll` unless the explicit pause pathway is activated.
2. IF automated tests simulate non-pausing inputs THEN the system SHALL keep existing behaviors unchanged and SHALL assert no unexpected transitions to `LoopState::Paused`.
3. WHEN regression tests execute THEN new coverage SHALL flag any accidental pause trigger from existing control mappings.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Pause-related logic SHALL concentrate within the input handling and loop engine layers, while audio command dispatch remains encapsulated in the audio module.
- **Modular Design**: `AudioCommand`, `AudioBus`, and `LoopEngine` extensions SHALL expose narrow interfaces so tests can isolate pause/resume effects.
- **Dependency Management**: UI components SHALL observe state changes without directly invoking audio commands, avoiding new cross-module coupling.
- **Clear Interfaces**: Any new structs (e.g., saved offset data) SHALL publish explicit fields or accessors to guide resume computations.

### Performance
- Pause and resume transitions SHALL propagate to the audio thread within 1 ms wall-clock latency under nominal load (≤8 concurrent tracks).
- The solution SHALL avoid re-allocating audio buffers during pause/resume to prevent glitches.

### Security
- The feature SHALL avoid exposing new channels for unvalidated input; only the existing keyboard event pipeline may trigger pause/resume.

### Reliability
- Unit and integration tests SHALL verify pause/resume sequences across playback and recording states, guaranteeing deterministic outcomes.
- The system SHALL recover gracefully if audio sinks already stopped, ensuring multiple consecutive pauses do not deadlock the engine.

### Usability
- UI feedback (e.g., status indicators) SHALL update within the next render frame so performers receive immediate confirmation of the pause state.
- Documentation SHALL describe the spacebar pause/resume behavior in the user guide once implemented.
