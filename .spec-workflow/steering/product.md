# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
DJing, samplers, and drum machines are great entry points into music creation, but expensive hardware/software creates high barriers to access. TermiGroove reduces this barrier by providing a retro‑futuristic, minimal TUI sampler that enables people to combine, blend, and shape samples like creative materials, and to share both creations and the creative process in real time.

## Target Users
- Men and women in their 20s living in Japan
- Small groups who hang out together and want to co‑create music in real time using only their laptops
- Newcomers to music making seeking a low‑friction, portable entry point

## Key Features
1. **TUI Sampler (minimal, retro‑futuristic design)**: Fast, keyboard‑driven sampling and playback.
2. **Real‑time Co‑creation Sessions**: Share sample sources and collaboratively jam with friends.
3. **Laptop‑only Portability & Simple Onboarding**: No expensive hardware; quick to start and share.

## Business Objectives
- Enable accessible, social music creation experiences on commodity laptops.
- Catalyze group co‑creation behaviors that drive retention and organic growth.
- Achieve initial traction with the target demographic in Japan and expand via word‑of‑mouth.

## Success Metrics
**Acquisition & Onboarding**
- Achieve 10,000 MAUs among 20s in Japan within the first year.
- Reach 30% week‑1 retention for new users after onboarding.

**Engagement & Usage**
- ≥ 50% of active users participate in a group session at least once per month.
- Average session length ≥ 20 minutes for co‑creation sessions.

**Social & Sharing**
- 40% of created tracks/jams are shared in real time with at least one other user or group.
- 20,000 shared creations within the first year.

**Community & Growth**
- Build a base of 500 groups (3+ users who regularly co‑create together).
- 5% monthly organic growth driven by peer sharing.

## Product Principles
1. **Accessibility over Gear**: Prioritize low setup cost and portability over specialized hardware.
2. **Simplicity & Flow**: Minimal, keyboard‑first UX to keep users in creative flow.
3. **Social by Design**: Encourage sharing of both outputs and process to strengthen connections.

## Monitoring & Visibility (if applicable)
- **Dashboard Type**: TUI panels for levels, transport, and session state; optional CLI exports.
- **Real‑time Updates**: Event‑driven updates within the TUI.
- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Session length, active participants, samples used, share events.
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Export/share session states and recorded jams; future read‑only links.

## Future Vision
TermiGroove evolves into a platform for live, collaborative sampling. Near‑term focus: robust playback, snappy TUI ergonomics, and delightful sharing that “just works.”

### Potential Enhancements
- **Remote Access**: Out of scope for alpha; focus is offline, co‑located sessions.
- **Analytics**: Session history, usage trends, and performance metrics for improvements.
- **Collaboration**: Multi‑user session controls, commenting, and presence cues.
